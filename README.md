## Installation

Clone project and create environment with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate recontrol
```

**Note**: you may need to adjust the torch (cuda) version according to your GPU.

## LLM inference to obtain LLM-labeled data

`bash scripts/llm_inference.sh`

**Note** We use TogetherAI(https://api.together.ai) for all LLMs inference except GPT-4o. Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 that we use in this project is now deprecated by TogetherAI. Therefore, we provide the dataset labeled by Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 under `datasets/llm/zeroshot(fewshot)/mixtral822`

## Training SiDyP

`bash scripts/train.sh`
